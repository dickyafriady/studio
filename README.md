# Next.js Portfolio Starter

This is a Next.js starter project for building a personal portfolio website. It includes a basic project structure, a set of pre-configured components, and a testing environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all the tests in the `src/components/__tests__` directory.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/app`: Contains the main application pages.
- `src/components`: Contains the reusable React components.
- `src/components/__tests__`: Contains the tests for the components.
- `src/lib`: Contains the data for the portfolio (e.g., profile information, projects, blog posts).
- `public`: Contains the static assets (e.g., images).
